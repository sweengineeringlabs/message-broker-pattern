//! [`TaskQueue`] — competing-consumer work queue contract.

use futures::future::BoxFuture;

/// Competing-consumer work queue contract.
///
/// A task queue delivers each message to exactly one competing consumer, which
/// must acknowledge or reject it. Unlike [`crate::MessageBroker`], which fans
/// out every message to all subscribers, a task queue distributes work.
///
/// # Enqueue semantics
///
/// Enqueuing a task succeeds immediately. The task becomes available for
/// dequeue by any consumer.
///
/// # Dequeue semantics
///
/// Each call to [`dequeue`] returns an independent [`TaskHandle`] for exactly
/// one task. If no tasks are available, implementations may block, return
/// `None`, or return an error. See the specific implementation for details.
///
/// A consumer MUST call either `ack()` or `nack()` on the handle:
/// - **ack()** — task is removed from the queue permanently
/// - **nack()** — task is returned to the queue for redelivery after a
///   visibility timeout
///
/// If neither is called, the task reappears after the visibility timeout.
///
